Raspberry Pi Pico Tea Maker

I kept forgetting to take the teabag out on time so i build this little script.

If it is plugged in the blue LED is ON.
You can pres the first button and the script starts (Red LED is ON). 
the script will wait 2 minutes and then lift the teabag a little (it's like sturring) and the yellow LED is ON during the proccess.
Then it will wait for another 2 minutes and sturr again (Yellow LED is ON again).
After the next 2 minutes it will take the teabag out and you can take the cup (Green LED is ON).

The next button releavies the teabag (Green LED turns OFF).

Now you can do it again.

If you wanna give me feedback or talk about it: teamakerpico@herrmannsven.de
